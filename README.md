# üß™ eBay Related Products QA Assessment

This project is part of a **QA skills assessment**. It demonstrates both **manual and automated testing** of a feature on **eBay's product detail page** that displays related *best-seller products* when viewing an item like a wallet.

---

## ‚úÖ Test Case Coverage

The automated tests cover the following scenarios from the assignment:

- ‚úÖ Product search and listing validation  
- ‚úÖ Product detail page opens in a new tab  
- ‚úÖ "Similar Items" section visibility  
- ‚úÖ Title and price of the selected product  
- ‚úÖ Asserted max 6 best seller products shown  

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Note**  
> Tests involving **dynamic pricing, category comparison, or fallback logic** were skipped due to unpredictable DOM/data structures on eBay. These can be validated manually or with backend access.

---

## ‚ú® Features

- Page Object Model implementation for better maintainability  
- Data-driven testing using JSON-based test data  
- Fixtures used to manage browser context and share page objects  
- Environment variables used to handle configurable data like base URLs  
- Robust Playwright assertions for visibility, text validation, and element counts
